/**
 * Andrew Williamson / P113357 
 * Date: 04/08/2021 
 * Java 3 Assessment 2 Question 3 â€“
 * 
 * You are required to make a list of different annual salaries for payroll in
 * whole numbers that will then need to be sorted, 
 * You should have alternate methods of sorting so that payroll can decide 
 *  on which method they would like to use.
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * You need to create an application that creates lists of integers 
 *  between 1 and 10 million. 
 * Sort in three different styles with timers to indicate the speed at which
 *  this happens. 
 * You must have at least 100,000 items in your list as the future business 
 *  strategy is to employ at least this many staff. 
 * Your sorting algorithm must have a comparator.
 * 1 sorting technique should use the inbuilt sorting the rest you 
 *  must write yourself.
