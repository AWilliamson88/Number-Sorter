/**
 * Andrew Williamson / P113357 Date: 04/08/2021 Java 3 Assessment 2 Question 3 â€“
 * You are required to make a list of different annual salaries for payroll in
 * whole numbers (integers) that will then need to be sorted, you should have
 * alternate methods of sorting so that payroll can decide on which method they
 * would like to use. You need to create an application that creates lists of
 * integers between 1 and 10 million. Your application must have the ability to
 * sort in three different styles with timers to indicate the speed at which
 * this happens you must have at least 100,000 items in your list as this the
 * future business strategy to employ at least this many staff members. The current
 * system is only able to handle 12 staff. Only 1 sorting technique may use the
 * inbuilt sorting the rest you must write yourself. In addition, you must list
 * the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm. Your sorting algorithm
 * must have a comparator.
